Complete the code for the 2 functions below so that when a button is clicked, the colors of the page are changed accordingly.

For example:
- one clicks on the "Dark mode" button
- the darkmode function gets executed
- the background color of the page is set to the background inside the "darkMode" object

Bonus: create a custom color scheme with color of your choices. Create a new button and a new function to change the color scheme to the one you made.
